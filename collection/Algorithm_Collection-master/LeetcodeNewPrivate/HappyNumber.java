Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of 
the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 
(where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that 
do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)


An example of a happy number is 19: 

1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
