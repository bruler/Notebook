 Problem:    Clone Graph
 Difficulty: Easy
 Source:     http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/
 Notes:
 Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.
 
 OJ's undirected graph serialization:
 Nodes are labeled from 0 to N - 1, where N is the total nodes in the graph.
 We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for each neighbor of the node.
 As an example, consider the serialized graph {1,2#2#2}.
 The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.
 Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
 Connect node 1 to node 2.
 Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
 Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/

 Solution: 1. DFS. 2. BFS.
