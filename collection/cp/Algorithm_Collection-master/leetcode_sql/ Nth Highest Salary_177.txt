Total Accepted: 385 Total Submissions: 2912

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200.
If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N  INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (

      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    
    --   select if(s=2147483648, null, s)  from (
    --   (select 2147483648 as s)
    --   union all
    --   (select distinct Salary as s from Employee)
    --   ) x
    --   order by s Desc limit N, 1
    
    SELECT DISTINCT(Emp1.Salary) FROM Employee Emp1 WHERE (N-1) = (SELECT COUNT(
    DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary))
    FROM Employee Emp2 WHERE Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
      
      );
END
